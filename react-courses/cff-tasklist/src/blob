reactDOM.render(what to render, where to render)

so the div segmant in index.html is basically where all our writtten code in gonna be stuck into. when we wrote where to render the 
things, it should be pointing to this div segmant. For this were gonna use document.getElemntbyId("root")

JSX is like a version of js for HTML/ whatever we write in jsx will all boil down to vanilla JS and that's why we need the React imported.
 as it does the work under the hood
